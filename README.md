# 7S-Str-Calc

A string calculator function for addition written using Python3. Tests run with pytest.
The Add() method takes a string and adds the delimited numbers together, and returns that result.

The addition function can be run from terminal with:
```python3 string_calculator.py```

The tests can be run in an environment with pytest with:
```python -m pytest```

If pytest is not present, tests can be run by
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pytest
python -m pytest
```
